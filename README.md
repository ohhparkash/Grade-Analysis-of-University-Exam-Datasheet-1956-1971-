# Grade-Analysis-of-University-Exam-Datasheet-1952-1971
Grade Analysis - Recap Sheet Wise

This is my Semester 4 University Project developed as part of my coursework in Database Systems & Web Development.  
The project focuses on building a Grade Analysis Web Application that displays recap sheet–wise grade distributions using a PostgreSQL database, Express.js backend, and a Firebase-hosted frontend built with Alpine.js.

Features
- Filter by Year → Semester → Class → Recap Sheet
- View Grade Distribution (Grade, Student Count, Percentage)
- REST API built with Express.js
- PostgreSQL as the database (hosted on Neon)
- Deployed live on Firebase Hosting
- Secure database connection with environment variables

Frontend:  
- HTML5, CSS3  
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) (lightweight reactive framework)  

Backend:
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

Database:
- PostgreSQL (Neon cloud-hosted instance)  

Deployment:
- Firebase Hosting
